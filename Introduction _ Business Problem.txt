After growing support for traffic cameras in Seattle, the Seattle Police Department has been allocated funds to install security cameras around the city.  These cameras will be able to take high-resolution photos when presented with a stimulus such as a car going above the speed limit.  


Unfortunately, funding is not sufficient to ensure that roads will be completely covered.   As a result, the Seattle Police Department needs to prioritize areas that are the most dangerous for camera placement.
